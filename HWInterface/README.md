HWInterface
===========
Git Repository for PH2DAQ HW Interface API

Supposed to contain:

• A middleware API layer, implemented in C++, which will basically wrap to abstracted functions the firmware calls and handshakes currently hardcoded into DAQ systems software.

• The standard XDAQ-based system, which could really benefit in its future versions of the previous two proposed APIs.
