Git Repository for P\-H2\-D\-A\-Q H\-W Interface A\-P\-I \& H\-W Description A\-P\-I

Supposed to contain\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A middleware A\-P\-I layer, implemented in C++, which will basically wrap to abstracted functions the firmware calls and handshakes currently hardcoded into D\-A\-Q systems software.
\item A C++ object-\/based library describing the system components (C\-B\-Cs, Hybrids, Boards) and their properties(values, status)
\item The standard X\-D\-A\-Q-\/based system, which could really benefit in its future versions of the previous two proposed A\-P\-Is.
